## what are software system design steps in detail

Software system design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a software system to satisfy specified requirements. The following are the typical steps in software system design:

### 1. Requirement Analysis
 
This step involves gathering and analyzing the user requirements for the software system. This includes identifying the functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and assumptions.

The purpose of Requirement Analysis is to understand the user's needs and expectations and to define the scope of the software system.

Requirement Analysis typically involves the following activities:

1. Gathering Requirements: This involves collecting information from the stakeholders, including end-users, customers, business analysts, and subject matter experts. Requirements can be gathered using different techniques, such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and focus groups.

2. Defining Requirements: Once the requirements are gathered, they need to be defined and documented in a clear and concise manner. Requirements should be categorized as functional or non-functional  and should be prioritized based on their importance and impact on the software system.

3. Analyzing Requirements: After defining the requirements, they need to be analyzed to identify any conflicts, ambiguities, or gaps. This involves reviewing the requirements with stakeholders, identifying potential risks, and resolving any conflicts or inconsistencies.

4. Validating Requirements: Once the requirements are analyzed, they need to be validated to ensure that they meet the business needs and are feasible to implement. This involves reviewing the requirements with the stakeholders and obtaining their approval and sign-off.

The outcome of Requirement Analysis is a ** Requirements Specification document** that includes a detailed description of the functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, system constraints, assumptions, and any other information relevant to the software system. 

The Requirements Specification document serves as a basis for the design, development, testing, and maintenance of the software system.

Requirement Analysis is critical to the success of software development as it ensures that the software system meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders and helps to avoid costly rework and delays later in the software development life cycle.

### 2.System Architecture

Based on the requirements, a system architecture is designed. This includes defining the components of the system, their relationships, and their interactions. It also involves selecting the appropriate architectural pattern, such as client-server, microservices, or event-driven architecture.

System Architecture is the process of designing and defining the overall structure, organization, and behavior of a software system. System Architecture plays a crucial role in the software development life cycle as it establishes the foundation for the system's design and implementation.

The key activities involved in System Architecture include the following:

1. Identifying System Components: This involves identifying the key components that make up the software system, including hardware, software, network infrastructure, and external interfaces. The components are organized into subsystems and modules based on their functionality and interdependencies.

2. Defining Component Interactions: This involves defining how the components interact with each other and how they exchange data and information. This includes defining the communication protocols, message formats, and data structures used by the components.

3. Designing System Interfaces: This involves designing the interfaces between the software system and external systems or users. This includes defining the input/output formats, user interfaces, and communication protocols used by the system.

4. Establishing System Constraints: This involves identifying and establishing any constraints or limitations that affect the system's design and implementation. This includes technical constraints, such as hardware and software compatibility, as well as business constraints, such as budget and time constraints.

5. Evaluating Alternative Architectures: This involves evaluating different architectural options and selecting the one that best meets the system's requirements and constraints. This includes considering factors such as performance, scalability, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness.

The output of System Architecture is a detailed description of the system's components, interactions, and interfaces, as well as the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution. The **System Architecture document** serves as a basis for the system's design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.


### 3. High-Level/Architectural Design

This step involves designing the system at a high level of abstraction. It includes defining the modules, interfaces, and data structures for the system. The design should be modular and cohesive, with each module having a clear responsibility and well-defined interfaces.

Examples of High-Level Design include:

1. Database Design: the software system's data storage mechanisms are designed and specified, including the database schema, tables, and relationships between the tables.

2. User Interface Design: the software system's user interface is designed and specified, including the layout, color scheme, and interaction mechanisms used by the user.

3. System Architecture Design: the software system's overall architecture is refined and extended, including the components, interactions, and constraints used by the system.

4. Network Architecture Design: the software system's network architecture is designed and specified, including the protocols, routing mechanisms, and security mechanisms used to transmit data between the system's components.

### 4. Detailed Design

In this step, each module is designed in detail. The design should be consistent with the high-level design and conform to the coding standards and best practices. The detailed design should include algorithms, data structures, error handling, and performance considerations.


### 5. Implementation Planning

Once the design is complete, the implementation plan is created. This includes defining the coding standards, testing approach, deployment strategy, and project management plan.

### 6. Design Review

The design is reviewed by stakeholders to ensure that it meets the requirements and is consistent with the architectural and coding standards.


## when is the testing done

Testing is an integral part of the software development life cycle and is typically performed throughout the development process. The following are the different stages of testing that are typically performed:

1. Unit Testing: done by developers to test individual units or components of the software system. The purpose is to identify and fix defects in the code at an early stage.

2. Integration Testing: test the interactions between different components of the software system. The purpose is to ensure that the components work together as expected and that the system as a whole meets the requirements.

3. System Testing: test the entire software system as a whole. The purpose is to ensure that the software system meets the functional and non-functional requirements and that it is ready for deployment.

4. Acceptance Testing: done by the end-users or stakeholders to verify that the software system meets the business requirements and is acceptable for deployment.

5. Regression Testing: done after making changes to the software system to ensure that the changes have not introduced any new defects or regressions.

6. Performance Testing: test the performance of the software system under various conditions such as load, stress, and concurrency. The purpose is to ensure that the software system meets the performance requirements.

Testing is an ongoing process throughout the software development life cycle, and each stage of testing is important to ensure that the software system is of high quality and meets the requirements. Testing should be done early and often to identify and fix defects at an early stage, which reduces the cost and time required for fixing defects later in the development process.
