broadcasting videos to millions of users, like youtube, zoom or twitch, there is some sort of events broadcasted to millions of users, how can you handle this problem?

1. what are the requirements from the user's perspective

2. pick up the most important features first "abstract concepts"

3. reduce these features to data definitions, the data then maped into objects and then to the database

4. once you defined the data that you need to store, you need to define the endpoints through which this data is manipulated/ queried => API

5. think of the engineering requirements

6. make sure that non of the services fail in case of outage, prevent single point of failure

7. think about extensibility, how easy it is to change the tichnical solution that you choose => reduce coupling

8. remember you past experiences and the current solutions used y similar projects to you, ased on that combined knowlege you can build a system that can scale and extend when the requirements change


now for the live streaming system, what are the main requirements:

1. Video and Audio Streaming: The system should be able to stream video and audio content to viewers in real-time. The streaming should be reliable and smooth, without buffering or lagging.

2. User Management: The system should allow users to create and manage their accounts, including signing in, signing out, and modifying their account details.

3. Multi-User Broadcasting: The system should support broadcasting video to multiple users simultaneously, allowing content creators to reach a large audience.

4. failproof

4.1. Redundancy: The system should have redundant components, such as servers or network connections, to ensure continued operation in the event of a failure or outage.

4.2. Error Handling: The system should include robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to handle errors and failures gracefully, without interrupting the streaming or causing data loss.

4.3. Backup and Recovery: The system should have backup and recovery mechanisms in place to recover from disasters or failures, such as restoring from backups or failover to redundant components.

4.4. Load Balancing: The system should implement load balancing mechanisms to distribute traffic across multiple components, such as servers or network connections, to prevent overload and ensure continued operation.

4.5. Monitoring and Alerting: The system should include monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect failures or issues and notify system administrators or support staff.

4.6. Fail-Safe Mode: The system should have a fail-safe mode that activates in the event of a failure or error, such as switching to a backup server or reducing the quality of the stream to ensure continued operation.

4.7. Disaster Recovery Plan: The system should have a disaster recovery plan that outlines the steps to take in the event of a major failure or outage, such as switching to backup components or notifying customers and stakeholders.

5. Monetization: The system should include features for content creators to monetize their content, such as advertising, sponsorships, and subscription models.

6. Interactive Features: The system should include interactive features that allow content creators to engage with their viewers, such as polls, surveys, and live Q&A sessions.

7. Real-Time Video Processing: The system should be able to process video in real-time, such as applying filters or effects, to enhance the viewing experience and engage viewers.

8. graceful degradation of video quality " in case of low bandwidth" this is called  Adaptive Bitrate Streaming: The system should support adaptive bitrate streaming, which adjusts the video quality based on the user's internet connection speed and device capabilities, to ensure smooth playback and reduce buffering.

9. Quality of Service (QoS): The system should provide QoS guarantees to ensure the streaming quality is consistent and reliable, even under high load or network congestion.

9. Compatibility: The system should be compatible with different devices and platforms, including desktops, laptops, mobile devices, and different operating systems and browsers.

10. Content Management: The system should allow content creators to upload and manage their content, including live streams, pre-recorded videos, and other media.

11. Live Chat: The system should include a live chat feature that allows viewers to interact with content creators and other viewers in real-time.

12. Content Discovery: The system should include features for users to discover new content, including recommended content, trending content, and search functionality.

13. Integration with Third-Party Services: The system should allow integration with third-party services, such as analytics tools, advertising platforms, or payment gateways, to provide additional functionality and monetization opportunities.

14. Content Moderation: The system should provide tools for content creators to moderate their content, such as filtering out inappropriate language, blocking or banning users, and removing offensive content.
