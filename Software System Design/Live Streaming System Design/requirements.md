broadcasting videos to millions of users, like youtube, zoom or twitch, there is some sort of events broadcasted to millions of users, how can you handle this problem?

1. what are the requirements from the user's perspective
2. pick up the most important features first "abstract concepts"
3. reduce these features to data definitions, the data then maped into objects and then to the database
