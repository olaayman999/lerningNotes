## define large scale distributed systems in software engineering 

A large-scale distributed system in software engineering is a complex software architecture that is designed to handle a large amount of data and processing tasks across multiple networked machines or nodes. The system is designed to be fault-tolerant, scalable, and reliable, allowing it to operate even if individual components fail.

Large-scale distributed systems are used in a wide range of applications, including cloud computing, big data processing, and high-performance computing. These systems typically consist of a large number of interconnected nodes, each of which may perform a specific function, such as processing data or storing information.

Designing and building large-scale distributed systems requires expertise in areas such as networking, distributed algorithms, concurrency, and fault tolerance. It also requires careful consideration of factors such as load balancing, data partitioning, and communication protocols to ensure that the system can handle large amounts of data and processing tasks efficiently and reliably.


why google maps is consideried large scale?
  1. it stores and processes large amounts of data
  2. used by very large number of people
  3. it is being updated very frequently
  4. it has a lot of performance expectations
