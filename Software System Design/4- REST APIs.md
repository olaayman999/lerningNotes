## define  REST API

A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a web-based architectural style for building web services that follows a set of constraints and principles. RESTful APIs are designed to be stateless, scalable, and highly interoperable, meaning they can be easily used and understood by a wide range of clients, from web browsers to mobile applications.

The fundamental principle of a REST API is the use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to interact with resources (data objects) on a web server. Each resource is identified by a unique URL  and can be accessed, created, updated, or deleted CRUD using the appropriate HTTP method.

A RESTful API typically uses a lightweight data format, such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), to represent the resources and their associated data.

The API response includes a status code indicating the success or failure of the request, as well as any data or metadata associated with the resource being accessed.

One of the key benefits of RESTful APIs is that they allow developers to build modular, scalable, and highly decoupled web applications that can be easily integrated with other applications and services.

REST APIs can be used for a wide range of purposes, from simple data retrieval to complex transactions involving multiple resources and data sources.


## give example using GET

Suppose we have a RESTful API that provides information about books in a library. To retrieve information about a specific book, we can use the GET method with the URL of the book resource, like this:

```bash
GET /api/books/12345
```
In this example, "`12345`" is the unique identifier of the book resource. When the client sends the `GET` request to the server, the server will retrieve the corresponding book resource and return it in the response body, using a lightweight data format such as JSON:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": "12345",
    "title": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy",
    "author": "Douglas Adams",
    "year": 1979,
    "publisher": "Pan Books",
    "isbn": "9780330258647"
}
```
In this response, the API returns the book resource in JSON format, including various attributes such as the book title, author, year of publication, publisher, and ISBN number.


### so the pervious APIs for twitter, maps and spotify are RESTful?

Yes, the APIs for Twitter, Google Maps, and Spotify can all be considered RESTful APIs, as they conform to the key principles and constraints of REST architecture.

For example, the Twitter API provides resources such as tweets, users, and lists, which can be accessed using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and DELETE, and are identified using unique URLs. The API uses a lightweight data format (JSON) to represent the resources and their associated data, and returns status codes to indicate the success or failure of the request.

Similarly, the Google Maps API provides resources such as maps, geocoding, and directions, which can be accessed using HTTP methods and unique URLs, and are represented using a lightweight data format (JSON or XML). The API also returns status codes to indicate the success or failure of the request, as well as error messages and other metadata as needed.

The Spotify API provides resources such as artists, albums, and playlists, which can be accessed using HTTP methods and unique URLs, and are represented using JSON or other data formats. The API also provides OAuth authentication and authorization mechanisms, as well as rate limiting and other features to help developers build scalable and secure applications.

So while each of these APIs may have its own specific features and conventions, they can all be considered RESTful APIs due to their adherence to the basic principles of REST architecture.


## give an example of a non RESTful API request response pair

Request:

```bash
POST /api/getUser HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 25

username=johndoe&password=1234

```
Response:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain

User ID: 123456
Name: John Doe
Email: john.doe@example.com
```
In this example, we're making a POST request to the `/api/getUser` endpoint of a **hypothetical API** to retrieve information about a user. However, this API is not RESTful, as it doesn't follow the key principles of REST architecture.

For example, the request doesn't identify a specific resource using a unique URL or URI; instead, it uses a generic endpoint with a verb that suggests an action to be performed. The request also includes data in the body using the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format, rather than using a standardized data format like JSON.

Similarly, the response doesn't follow the standard conventions of RESTful APIs, as it doesn't return a resource representation in a lightweight data format like JSON or XML. Instead, it returns plain text data that includes multiple fields, some of which may not be relevant to the client.

Overall, while this example may illustrate a typical API request/response pair for some non-RESTful APIs, it's important to note that there are many different variations and conventions that can be used for building APIs, depending on the specific requirements and use cases.

### what is a hypothetical API

A hypothetical API is a term used to describe a fictitious or imaginary API that is created for the purpose of explaining concepts or demonstrating how APIs work without using real-world examples.

Hypothetical APIs can be used in tutorials, documentation, and other educational materials to provide a simplified and consistent example that is easy to understand and follow. They may include sample requests and responses, as well as descriptions of the various endpoints, methods, and parameters that the API supports.

By using a hypothetical API, developers and users can experiment with different scenarios and learn how to use APIs without affecting real data or systems.

## are all data in servers are objects?

No, not all data in servers are necessarily objects. Servers may store different types of data, including objects, files, databases, and more.

Objects are typically used in object-oriented programming languages to represent a collection of related data and behaviors. In the context of server-side programming, objects may be used to represent various entities such as user accounts, products, orders, or other domain-specific concepts.

However, servers may also store other types of data, such as static files (such as images, videos, or HTML pages), configuration files, log files, and more. 

Databases are another common type of data storage on servers, and they may store data in various formats such as tables, documents, key-value pairs, or graphs, depending on the database management system used.

So while objects can be one type of data stored on servers, there are many other types of data that may be stored as well, depending on the specific requirements of the server-side application.


## how frames are handled in JSON response 

In a JSON response, frames are not used or handled in the same way as they are in video or animation formats. Instead, JSON represents data as a set of key-value pairs, where the _keys are strings and the values can be of various types, including other JSON objects or arrays._

**JSON doesn't have a specific concept of frames**, as it's primarily designed for representing structured data. However, some applications or APIs may use a similar concept of pagination or partial responses to handle large datasets, where the server returns a subset of the full data in each response.

For example, an API that returns a list of user accounts may return the first 10 accounts in the initial response, along with a **pagination token or link that can be used to request the next page of results.** This way, the API can handle large datasets more efficiently and reduce the amount of data transferred over the network.

In summary, JSON doesn't handle frames in the same way as video or animation formats, but some APIs may use similar concepts like pagination or partial responses to handle large datasets.


### more about pagination and partial responses

When an API returns a large amount of data, it can be inefficient and overwhelming to return all the data at once. To address this issue, some APIs and applications may use pagination or partial responses to manage large datasets.

Pagination is a technique that involves dividing the large dataset into smaller, more manageable portions or pages. The API returns the first page of data in the response, along with a reference to the next page. The client can then request the next page of data by using the reference in the response, and the process repeats until all the data is retrieved.

Partial responses involve requesting only a subset of the data fields that are available in the response. For example, if an API returns a large JSON object with many fields, a partial response could be used to request only the fields that the client is interested in. This can reduce the amount of data that is transferred over the network, making the response more efficient and faster.

Both pagination and partial responses are used to handle large datasets in a more efficient and manageable way.

Using pagination or partial responses can help prevent excessive data exposure vulnerabilities by reducing the amount of data that is returned in each API response.

By limiting the amount of data that is returned, the API can reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information that should not be accessible to the client.


## give an example of a twitter user opening a tweet that contain a video, it has mute autoplay enabled, i want the full requests and responses

Here's an example of a sequence of requests and responses that may occur when a Twitter user opens a tweet with a video that has mute autoplay enabled:

The user opens the Twitter app/website and clicks on a tweet with a video.

The Twitter app/website sends a `GET` request to the Twitter API to fetch the metadata for the tweet, including the URL for the video.

```bash
GET https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/show.json?id=<tweet_id>
```
The Twitter API returns a JSON response with the metadata for the tweet, including the URL for the video.

```json

{
  "created_at": "Tue Feb 22 16:52:07 +0000 2022",
  "id": 1234567890123456789,
  "text": "Check out this awesome video!",
  "user": {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "screen_name": "jsmith",
    "profile_image_url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1234567890/jsmith.jpg"
  },
  "entities": {
    "media": [
      {
        "type": "video",
        "media_url": "https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1234567890/pu/vid/640x360/abcdef1234567890.mp4",
        "video_info": {
          "aspect_ratio": [
            16,
            9
          ],
          "duration_millis": 30000,
          "variants": [
            {
              "content_type": "video/mp4",
              "url": "https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1234567890/pu/vid/640x360/abcdef1234567890.mp4",
              "bitrate": 832000,
              "is_default": true
            },
            {
              "content_type": "video/mp4",
              "url": "https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1234567890/pu/vid/320x180/abcdef1234567890.mp4",
              "bitrate": 320000,
              "is_default": false
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
The Twitter app/website sends a request to the video URL to start loading the video for playback.
```bash
GET https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1234567890/pu/vid/640x360/abcdef1234567890.mp4
```
The Twitter server returns the video file in chunks (using HTTP chunked transfer encoding), and the Twitter app or website starts playing the video with mute autoplay enabled.

Note that the above example is a simplified version of what happens in reality, and there may be additional requests and responses involved depending on the specific implementation of the Twitter app or website. Additionally, the actual URLs and response payloads may be different in different scenarios.



### what is HTTP chunked transfer encoding

HTTP chunked transfer encoding is a method of transferring data over HTTP in which the response is sent in a series of chunks, rather than as a single, continuous stream. This method is often used when the size of the response is not known in advance, or when the response is being generated on the fly.

When using chunked transfer encoding, the response is divided into a series of chunks, each of which is sent separately with its own header indicating the size of the chunk. The chunks are sent in order and concatenated by the client to form the final response.

The use of chunked transfer encoding allows the server to begin sending the response before the entire response is ready, which can help reduce latency and improve performance. It can also be used to stream data to the client in real-time, such as when streaming video or audio content.

Chunked transfer encoding is supported by all modern web browsers and HTTP servers, and is specified in the HTTP/1.1 protocol. It is typically used when the content length of the response cannot be determined in advance or when the response is being generated dynamically.


### is this the standard way of sending video data from server to client

While HTTP chunked transfer encoding can be used to send video data from server to client, it is not the standard way of doing so.

When it comes to streaming video data, other protocols and technologies such as:
- RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol)
- HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)
- MPEG-DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) 
- WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) 

are typically used. These protocols and technologies are specifically designed for real-time streaming of media content and offer features such as adaptive bitrate streaming, low latency, and error correction.

That being said, HTTP chunked transfer encoding can be used to stream video data over HTTP, but it may not offer the same level of performance, reliability, and features as other dedicated streaming protocols and technologies.


### which one does youtube use

YouTube uses a proprietary streaming protocol called Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). DASH is an adaptive bitrate streaming technology that allows YouTube to serve videos at different quality levels and bitrates based on the user's internet connection speed and device capabilities.

When a user requests to watch a video on YouTube, the server uses DASH to break down the video into small chunks and send them to the user's device in real-time. The user's device then selects the appropriate bitrate and quality level based on the available bandwidth and display capabilities.

DASH is based on standard web technologies like HTTP, and uses standard media formats like MP4 and WebM, making it compatible with a wide range of devices and platforms. DASH also offers low latency and fast start-up times, making it ideal for streaming high-quality video content over the internet.
