This particular example shows that the user "johndoe" successfully logged on to the computer named "MyComputerName" on March 1, 2022 at 10:30 AM. The logon was performed using Kerberos authentication, and the user's credentials were verified by the domain controller. The event also shows the network address of the computer from which the logon attempt originated.

##what is Restricted Admin Mode: -

In Windows operating systems, "Restricted Admin Mode" is a security feature that allows administrators to perform certain administrative tasks without exposing their credentials to the remote computer they are administering.

When "Restricted Admin Mode" is enabled, the credentials of the administrator are not sent to the remote computer in plaintext, which helps to prevent credential theft attacks. Instead, the administrator's credentials are only used on the local computer to create a restricted token that is used for the _remote administration session_. The restricted token has limited privileges and does not include any sensitive information, such as passwords or encryption keys.

In the context of an Event Viewer log for Event ID 4624, the value "-" for "Restricted Admin Mode" indicates that this feature was not used for the logon session. This means that the administrator's credentials were likely sent to the remote computer in plaintext during the logon process, which may present a security risk.
