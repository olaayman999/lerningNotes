In general, non-administrator users cannot clear logs on a Windows machine. By default, standard user accounts do not have the necessary permissions to perform administrative tasks like clearing event logs.

However, in some cases, non-administrator users may be able to clear specific logs if they have been granted explicit permissions to do so by an administrator. This can be done by modifying the security settings of the log in question.

It's important to note that granting non-administrator users the ability to clear logs can pose security risks, as it allows them to potentially cover up their actions or tamper with system logs. Therefore, granting such permissions should only be done if there is a specific and legitimate reason for doing so, and with careful consideration of the potential risks involved.

-------------------------------

When an error occurs, the system administrator or support representative must determine what caused the error, attempt to recover any lost data, and prevent the error from recurring. It is helpful if applications, the operating system, and other system services record important events, such as low-memory conditions or excessive attempts to access a disk. 

The system administrator can then use the event log to help determine what conditions caused the error and identify the context in which it occurred. By periodically viewing the event log, the system administrator may be able to identify problems (such as a failing hard disk) before they cause damage.

Because the logging functions are general purpose, you must decide what information is appropriate to log. Generally, you should log only information that could be useful in diagnosing a hardware or software problem. Event logging is not intended to be used as a tracing tool.

## Choosing Events to Log
The following are examples of cases in which event logging can be helpful:

1. Resource problems: Logging a Warning event when memory allocation fails can help indicate the cause of a low-memory situation.

2. Hardware problems. If a device driver encounters a disk controller time-out, a power failure in a parallel port, or a data error from a network or serial card, the _device driver_ can log information about these events to help the system administrator diagnose hardware problems.

3. Bad sectors. If a disk driver encounters a bad sector, it may be able to read from or write to the sector after retrying the operation, but the sector will go bad eventually. If the disk driver can proceed, it should log a Warning event; otherwise, it should log an Error event. If a file system driver finds a large number of bad sectors and fixes them, logging Warning events might help an administrator determine that the disk may be about to fail.

4. Information events. A server application (such as a database server) records a user logging on, opening a database, or starting a file transfer. The server can also log other events such as errors (cannot access file, host process disconnected, and so on), database corruption, or whether a file transfer was successful.
