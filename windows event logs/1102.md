In general, non-administrator users cannot clear logs on a Windows machine. By default, standard user accounts do not have the necessary permissions to perform administrative tasks like clearing event logs.

However, in some cases, non-administrator users may be able to clear specific logs if they have been granted explicit permissions to do so by an administrator. This can be done by modifying the security settings of the log in question.

It's important to note that granting non-administrator users the ability to clear logs can pose security risks, as it allows them to potentially cover up their actions or tamper with system logs. Therefore, granting such permissions should only be done if there is a specific and legitimate reason for doing so, and with careful consideration of the potential risks involved.
