A blind vulnerability is a security issue where an attacker can exploit a weakness in a system, but the results of the attack are not immediately apparent. Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, the attacker cannot observe the outcome of the attack directly, and instead has to rely on indirect information to determine if the attack was successful. This makes it more challenging for both the attacker and the defender to detect and remediate the vulnerability.

For example, in a SQL injection attack, the attacker can directly observe the results of their injection attempts by modifying the SQL query in such a way that it returns sensitive information from the database. However, in a blind SQL injection attack, the attacker has to guess the results of the injection based on the time delay or the error messages generated by the system.

Blind vulnerabilities can occur in various types of systems and applications, such as web applications, databases, and other types of software. They are often harder to detect and prevent compared to traditional vulnerabilities, making them a significant threat to security. As such, it's important to implement secure coding practices and to perform regular security testing to help identify and remediate these types of vulnerabilities.

With blind SQL injection vulnerabilities, many techniques such as UNION attacks, are not effective because they rely on being able to see the results of the injected query within the application's responses. It is still possible to exploit blind SQL injection to access unauthorized data, but different techniques must be used.

## what is sql substring
The SQL SUBSTRING function is a built-in string function in Structured Query Language (SQL) used to extract a portion of a string. It returns a new string that is a specified number of characters from a larger string, starting from a specified position. The syntax for the SUBSTRING function is as follows:
```sql
SUBSTRING(string, start_position, length)
```
"string" is the input string from which a portion is to be extracted.

"start_position" is the starting position in the string from where the extraction should begin. "1 base"

"length" is the number of characters to extract.

For example, if you have a string "OpenAI" and you want to extract the first three characters, you can use the following query:
```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING("OpenAI", 1, 3);
```
This will return the result "Open".

## Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering conditional responses
Consider an application that uses tracking cookies to gather analytics about usage. Requests to the application include a cookie header like this:

```php
Cookie: TrackingId=u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4
```
When a request containing a `TrackingId` cookie is processed, the application determines whether this is a known user using an SQL query like this:

```sql
SELECT TrackingId FROM TrackedUsers WHERE TrackingId = 'u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4'
```
This query is vulnerable to SQL injection, but the results from the query are not returned to the user. However, _the application does behave differently depending on whether the query returns any data_. If it returns data (because a recognized `TrackingId` was submitted), then a "Welcome back" message is displayed within the page.

suppose that two requests are sent containing the following TrackingId cookie values in turn this will help us determine the result 1 bit at a time:
```sql
…xyz' AND '1'='1 --welcome back
…xyz' AND '1'='2 --other responce
```
For example, suppose there is a table called `Users` with the columns `Username` and `Password`, and a user called `Administrator`. We can systematically determine the password for this user by sending a series of inputs to test the password one character at a time.

```sql
xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 'm
```
This returns the "Welcome back" message, indicating that the injected condition is true, and so the first character of the password is greater than m.
```sql
xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 't
```
This does not return the "Welcome back" message, indicating that the injected condition is false, and so the first character of the password is not greater than t.

Eventually, we send the following input, which returns the "Welcome back" message, thereby confirming that the first character of the password is s:

```sql 
xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 's
```
We can continue this process to systematically determine the full password for the `Administrator` user.

## Substring
You can extract part of a string, from a specified offset with a specified length. Note that the offset index is 1-based. Each of the following expressions will return the string ba.
```sql
Oracle      SUBSTR('foobar', 4, 2)
other       SUBSTRING('foobar', 4, 2)
```
## Lab: Blind SQL injection with conditional responses

to determine password length
```sql
' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>§1§)='a'--
```
Go to the Payloads tab, check that "Simple list" is selected, and under "Payload Options" add the payloads in the range a - z and 0 - 9. You can select these easily using the "Add from list" drop-down.

To be able to tell when the correct character was submitted, you'll need to grep each response for the expression "Welcome back". To do this, go to the Options tab, and the "Grep - Match" section. Clear any existing entries in the list, and then add the value "Welcome back".

then find the password by
```sql
' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,§1§,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='§a§'--
```
