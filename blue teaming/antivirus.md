Antivirus security is the process of protecting a computer from viruses. Antivirus software scans your computer for viruses and removes them before they can do any harm. It also protects your computer against future infections.

## Best Enterprise Antivirus
Some of the best enterprise antivirus providers include Symantec, McAfee, and Trend Micro. They offer a wide range of features, including malware detection, anti-phishing, and anti-spyware protection. They also have robust customer support services to help you get the most out of their products.


There are several disadvantages to using antivirus software, including:

1. Antivirus can’t protect against everything.
2. It can slow down your computer.
3. It can be expensive to maintain.
4. It can generate false positives (warnings about threats that aren’t present).
5. It can miss new threats that haven’t been identified yet.
6. It can be difficult to configure and manage.
7. It can create security holes if not properly configured.
8. It requires regular updates to stay effective.
9. It can be disabled or bypassed by malware.
10. It can give you a false sense of security.
11. The biggest and most important disadvantage of antivirus is that antivirus will only catch known threats. That means that if a new threat is released into the wild, your antivirus might not be able to detect it and protect you from it. This is a major limitation of antivirus software and why cybersecurity experts recommend AI-based software plus live monitoring of your endpoints for a more robust security plan.


AVs use various methods to identify potential malware infections, including:

1. Signature-Based Detection: identifies known threats based on signatures such as file hashes, command and control domains, IP addresses, and similar features.
2. Heuristic/anomaly Detection:  identifies malware based on unusual/malicious functionality. This enables it to identify _zero-day threats_ that signature-based detection would miss.
3. Rootkit Detection: identifies malware designed to acquire deep, administrative access to an infected computer.
4. Real-Time Detection: Real-time detection attempts to identify malware at time of use by scanning and monitoring recently-accessed files.


AV solutions enable the detection and remediation of malware infections on a computer. This can include terminating malicious processes, quarantining suspicious files, and eradicating malware infections.
