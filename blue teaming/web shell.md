## what is cmd parameter
In computing, the "cmd" parameter usually refers to a command-line argument or parameter that is passed to an application or program when it is launched from a command prompt or terminal window.

The "cmd" parameter is typically used to specify a command or operation that the program should perform, such as opening a specific file, executing a specific function, or performing a specific task. The command-line argument may also be used to specify configuration options, parameters, or settings that control the behavior of the program.

For example, in the Windows operating system, the "cmd" parameter can be used to open a command prompt window and execute a specific command or script. In the Linux operating system, the "cmd" parameter may be used to launch a terminal window and execute a specific command or program.

Overall, the "cmd" parameter is an important tool for running and controlling programs from the command line and is commonly used in system administration and programming tasks.


## how is it related to web shell
The "cmd" parameter is often used in web shells, which are malicious scripts or programs that provide an attacker with remote access and control over a web server.

Web shells typically have a command-line interface that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands and perform various operations on the compromised system, such as uploading or downloading files, executing scripts, creating user accounts, or launching Dos attacks.

The "cmd" parameter in web shells is used to pass commands to the shell, which then executes them on the compromised system. This allows the attacker to interact with the system as if they were physically present at the console, making it easier to compromise the system and maintain control over it.

For example, an attacker may use a web shell to gain access to a vulnerable web server, and then use the "cmd" parameter to execute commands such as downloading additional malware, scanning the network for other vulnerable systems, or launching attacks against other targets.

Overall, the "cmd" parameter is an important tool for attackers using web shells to gain unauthorized access to web servers and carry out malicious activities. It is important for system administrators and web developers to be aware of the risks posed by web shells and to take steps to prevent their installation and use on web servers.
