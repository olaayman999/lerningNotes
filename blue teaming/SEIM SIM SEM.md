Most organizations relying on cybersecurity experts to protect and defend their valuable assets, and many of these experts use cybersecurity frameworks to make sure they didnâ€™t miss a single point during their operations, most of these frameworks focuses on these concepts:

1. Protection and prevention controls

2. Monitoring and alerting : in a simple way, involve creating a baseline and each non-baseline event will be considered an incident

3. Incidence response : how do you respond to incidents? What is your incident plan? And how quickly you discover and respond to the incident, and finally what is the recovery plan

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a software solution that aggregates and analyzes activity from many different resources across your entire IT infrastructure, it prevents having any blind spots while monitoring and analyzing the entire system behavior, which reduces the likelihood of an unexpected attack. 

SIEM combines security event management (SEM) with security information management (SIM). SEM analyzes logs and events data and helps in providing threat monitoring, incident response, and event correlation. SIM, on the other hand, reports, collects, and analyzes log data

Security event management (SEM) and security information management (SIM) are two closely related concepts in the field of information security, but they have different focuses and purposes.

Both of these types of information collection have to do with collecting security log information or other similar data for long-term storage, or to analyze the security environment of a network.

The key difference is that in SIM, the technology is simply collecting information from a log, which may consist of various different types of data. In SEM, the technology is looking more closely at specific types of events. For instance, experts often cite a "superuser event" as something that security event management technology would be looking out for. You may imagine technologies specifically designed to look for suspicious authentications, account logons or high-level management access at specific times of the day or night.

In summary, SEM is focused on real-time event monitoring and response, while SIM is focused on data collection, analysis, and reporting to provide a broader understanding of an organization's security posture.

SIEM refers to technologies with some combination of SIM and SEM. Since these are already very similar, the broader umbrella term can be useful in describing modern security tools and resources. Again, the key is to differentiate the event monitoring from the general information monitoring. Another key way to distinguish these two is to look at SIM as a kind of long-term or broader process, where more diverse data sets may be analyzed in more methodical ways. SEM, by contrast, is again looking at the specific types of user events that may constitute red flags or tell administrators specific things about network activity.
