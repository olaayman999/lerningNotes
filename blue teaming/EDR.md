Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is an endpoint security solution that continuously monitors end-user devices to detect and respond to cyber threats like ransomware and malware.

EDR is defined as a solution that “records and stores endpoint-system-level behaviors, uses various data analytics techniques to detect suspicious system behavior, provides contextual information, blocks malicious activity, and provides remediation suggestions to restore affected systems.”

EDR record the activities and events taking place on endpoints and all workloads, providing security teams with the visibility they need to uncover incidents that would otherwise remain invisible. An EDR solution needs to provide continuous and comprehensive visibility into what is happening on endpoints in real time.

An EDR tool should offer advanced threat detection, investigation and response capabilities — including incident data search and investigation alert triage, suspicious activity validation, threat hunting, and malicious activity detection and containment.

## EDR
Some of the core components of an EDR include:

1. **Data Enrichment**: Individual alerts or event notifications from a single source could indicate a true threat or a benign anomaly. EDR security aggregate and analyze data from multiple sources, providing additional context for identifying potential threats.

EDR technology pairs comprehensive visibility across all endpoints with IOAs "Indicators of Attack". and applies behavioral analytics that analyze billions of events in real time to automatically detect traces of suspicious behavior.

Examples of IOAs that EDR solutions may look for include:

- Attempted privilege escalation
- Malware execution or attempted execution
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems
- Suspicious network traffic or communication
- Use of known or suspected malicious tools or techniques

By monitoring endpoints for these and other IOAs, EDR solutions can quickly detect and respond to potential threats before they cause significant damage or disruption.

2. **Alert Triage**: Alert overload is a common challenge for security teams, and many alerts are false positives. Based on context derived from multiple data sources, EDR can triage alerts, prioritizing the most likely and critical threats.

3. **Threat Hunting Support**: EDR solutions are designed to collect and analyze a large amount of endpoint security data. By providing this data to a security analyst, they can help with identifying undetected intrusions on corporate systems.

4. **Incident Response**: Context switching from threat detection to response wastes time and slows incident remediation. EDR solutions integrate incident response capabilities, enabling security analysts to _identify and mitigate intrusions within a single dashboard._

5. **Flexible Responses**: The right response to a security incident may vary based on numerous different factors. EDR solutions should provide analysts with multiple options for handling an incident.

6. **Provides Real-Time and Historical Visibility**:Real-time visibility across all your endpoints allows you to view adversary activities, even as they attempt to breach your environment, and stop them immediately.


In essence, EDR solutions are designed to streamline and optimize threat detection and response on corporate endpoints. They accomplish this by automating the process of collecting, aggregating, and analyzing security data, providing greater endpoint visibility and context to analysts.

## SIEM
SIEM solutions accomplish their purpose via a four-step process with the following steps:

1. Data Collection: SIEM solutions collect logs, alerts, and other security data from across the entire corporate IT network.

2. Data Aggregation and Normalization: SIEMs source security data from numerous systems with various data types and formats. At this stage, the SIEM translates security data into a consistent form for an “apples to apples” comparison.

3. Data Analytics and Policy Application: SIEMs use statistical analysis, corporate policies, and other analytical techniques to identify potential indicators of an attack or non-compliance with corporate security policies.

4. Alert Generation: In the event that a SIEM identifies a security threat, it will generate an alert for the security team. The solution may also leverage integrations with bug trackers, ticket systems, and similar tools to streamline the incident remediation process.

After the SIEM has completed its data collection and analytics, it has access to a rich pool of security data and threat intelligence. This data is then provided to a security analyst to optimize threat detection and response, threat hunting, post-incident forensics, and demonstrating regulatory compliance.

## EDR vs. SIEM
EDR and SIEM are both corporate security solutions that focus on improving incident detection and response by improving security _visibility_ and _context_. They **both collect data from multiple sources, analyze it, generate alerts regarding potential threats, and provide analysts with access to a rich pool of security data for threat identification, threat hunting, and similar activities.** However, EDR and SIEM are distinct security tools.

Some of the key differentiators between the two include the following:

1. Area of Focus: As their name suggests, EDR is primarily focused on monitoring and protecting the endpoint. In contrast, SIEM tools provide visibility across the entire corporate network.

2. Response Capabilities: EDR solutions are designed to support incident response, including the ability to respond automatically with predefined actions to certain threats. SIEM solutions, on the other hand, are primarily designed to support threat identification and have limited incident response capabilities.

3. Data Collection: An EDR security solution is deployed on the endpoint and has the ability to collect data directly from sources of interest. A SIEM is reliant on other solutions — including EDR tools — to send security data to it for analysis.

### Choose the Right Solution for Your Business
EDR and SIEM are security solutions that use similar methods to fulfill very different roles. An EDR solution is designed to _monitor and protect the endpoint_, while a SIEM provides security visibility across the entire corporate network. **A corporate security architecture should incorporate both EDR and SIEM functions, not one or the other.**
