Threat hunting and threat intelligence are two concepts in the field of information security that are often used together but have different focuses and purposes.

Threat intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and sharing information about potential and actual security threats to an organization. This information can come from various sources, such as security vendors, government agencies, security researchers, and open-source intelligence.

The goal of threat intelligence is to provide organizations with insights into emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attack techniques that may affect their security posture. Threat intelligence can be used to develop effective security strategies, identify and prioritize security risks, and improve incident response.

Threat hunting, on the other hand, is a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating security threats that may have gone undetected by traditional security measures. Threat hunting involves the use of advanced analytics and data analysis techniques to proactively search for signs of malicious activity in an organization's network or systems.

Threat hunters may use various tools and techniques to investigate potential security threats, such as network traffic analysis, system logs analysis, and endpoint analysis. The goal of threat hunting is to identify and respond to security threats before they can cause damage to an organization's systems or data.

In summary, threat intelligence is focused on collecting and analyzing information about potential and actual security threats, while threat hunting is a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating security threats that may have gone undetected by traditional security measures. Threat intelligence can help organizations to develop effective security strategies, while threat hunting can help them to identify and respond to security threats proactively.
